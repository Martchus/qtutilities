# qtutilities
Common Qt related C++ classes and routines used by my applications such as dialogs, widgets and models.

## Build instructions
Qt utilities depends on c++utilities and is built in the same way. So checkout this repository for further
instructions. The documentation for various CMake variables influencing the build is also provided in the
c++utilities repository.

The library also depends on the following Qt modules (only the latest Qt 5 and Qt 6 version tested):
core, gui, widgets

Some header files also require further Qt modules.
